Welcome to the Ultralytics HUB app for demonstrating YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models! In this app, available on the [Apple App
Store](https://apps.apple.com/xk/app/ultralytics/id1583935240) and the 
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ultralytics.ultralytics_app), you will be able
to see the power and capabilities of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model developed by Ultralytics.

**To install simply scan the QR code above**. The App currently features YOLOv5 models, with YOLOv8 models coming soon.

With YOLOv5, you can detect and classify objects in images and videos with high accuracy and speed. The model has been
trained on a large dataset and is able to detect a wide range of objects, including cars, pedestrians, and traffic
signs.

In this app, you will be able to try out YOLOv5 on your own images and videos, and see the model in action. You can also
learn more about how YOLOv5 works and how it can be used in real-world applications.

We hope you enjoy using YOLOv5 and seeing its capabilities firsthand. Thank you for choosing Ultralytics for your object
detection needs!
